    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your analysis here\n",
    "  \n",
    "School Type Performance: Charter schools outperform District schools in all metrics. Charter schools have higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher percentages of students passing math, reading, and both subjects combined.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Math and Reading Scores: On average, students in PyCity perform better in reading than in math across all schools. This is evident from the higher average reading scores compared to average math scores.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Passing Rates: The passing rates for both math and reading, as well as the overall passing rate (students passing both math and reading), are significantly higher in Charter schools compared to District schools.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "School Size: There doesn't appear to be a clear correlation between school size and academic performance. However, further analysis may be needed to understand any potential trends.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Per Student Budget: Higher per student budgets do not necessarily correlate with higher academic performance. This suggests that factors other than budget allocation may influence school performance.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Grade-Level Performance: There may be variations in performance between different grades within the same school. Further analysis by grade level could provide insights into areas of improvement.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Overall, the data suggests that school type (Charter vs. District) is a significant factor influencing academic performance in PyCity, with Charter schools consistently outperforming District schools. Further investigation into the practices and policies of Charter schools could provide insights into potential strategies for improving academic outcomes across all schools in PyCity."
